## Description
Using RxJs to process streams in real-time. 
In this talk you will get a overview over Reactive-Extensions and see it's usage in a live-coding session.

First you will get an introduction into Rx and it's history. 
After covering the basic concepts and terminologies 
we will get better understanding of observables by learning how to use marble diagrams for documentation.

In the live-coding session I create a morse-code generator to demonstrate stream processing in a playful way.
I will show you:
- how to create observables
- common operators to transform streams
- different ways to combine streams
- subscription handling
- error handling
- exposing observables
- how to use subjects to control streams
