# Real-Time stream processing with RxJs and Angular
#### A playful example of using RxJs to create a morse code generator (No Angular knowledge needed!)
 
## Agenda:
- Intro to RxJs
- How i am/What i do
- Marble-Diagrams
- Explaining the goal
- Overview over the code base we begin with
- Live coding
  - Use a button to create a stream of timestamps
  - Transform timestamps to dots (".") and dashes ("_")
  - Translate series of dost and dashes to readable text
  - Handling edge cases and errors
- Resources
- Good bye!

## Description
Using RxJs to process streams in real-time. 
In this talk you will get a overview over Reactive-Extensions and see it's usage in a live-coding session.

First you will get an introduction into Rx and it's history. 
After covering the basic concepts and terminologies 
we will get better understanding of observables and learn how to use marble-diagrams for documentation.

In the live-coding session I create a morse-code generator to demonstrate real-time stream processing in a playful way.

I will show you:
- how to create observables
- common operators to transform streams
- different ways to combine streams
- subscription handling
- error handling
- exposing observables
- how to use subjects to control streams

After the session you will have enough knowledge to start using Rx in any language not only in javascript.
